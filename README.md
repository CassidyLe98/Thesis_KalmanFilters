# Thesis_KalmanFilters
This repository is associated with a senior capstone project (thesis research) on how Kalman filtering, particularly extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF), can be applied to bioinformatics in order to accurately estimate states and parameters of a model given a dataset.
