# Thesis_KalmanFilters

## About
Kalman filtering is a type of Data Assimilation algorithm that can be used to estimate states and parameters of different models. Recently, researchers have been exploring the use of Kalman filters in bioinformatics. Here, we explore how Kalman filtering, particularly extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF), can be applied to bioinformatics in order to accurately estimate states and parameters of a model given a dataset. This work is associated with a senior capstone project (thesis research), of whcih the paper can be found through this [Google site page ](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/cle/thesis).

The repository includes MATLAB implementation of both EKF and UKF on various models. If you use this project for your research, please cite:
