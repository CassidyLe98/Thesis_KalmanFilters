# Paper_Figures
We provide the source files code for all figures that appear in the associated senior thesis research paper, which can be found through this [Google site page ](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/cle/thesis).

Most of these files were created using MATLAB. The MATLAB version used was R2016b, though any version after R2016b should also work.

## MATLAB Prerequisites
If you do not have MATLAB installed to your computer, please download MATLAB through [this link](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/).

If you are unfamiliar with MATLAB, please [MATLAB's documentation for getting started](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html).

## Installation
Once you have MATLAB downloaded and you are familiar with MATLAb syntax, download the repo
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/CassidyLe98/Thesis_KalmanFilters
  ```
Then, access this folder in your directory under `../Thesis_KalmanFilters/Paper_Figures/`

## Contents
The `/Paper_Figures/` folder consists of 20 different source files that all produce figures. All but one of the figures were produced using MATLAB. The one file called `KF_diagram.ppxt` is a file in Microsoft PowerPoint format, though it should be accessible in other formats if you would like.

The file in this director called `Icon` is file used to sync with Google Drive File Stream.
